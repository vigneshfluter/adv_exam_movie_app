# Movie Browser App 🎥

This is a **Movie Browser App** built using Flutter that allows users to search for movies via an API, view details, and save their favorite movies locally. The app implements an elegant UI with a grid-based movie display, detail pages, and a liked movies section managed with shared preferences.

### Functionalities
1. **API Integration**

     - API for a single movie: `https://www.omdbapi.com/?t={movie_name}&apikey={your_api_key}`  
     - API for multiple movies: `https://www.omdbapi.com/?s={movie_name}&apikey={your_api_key}`

   - Search for movies by entering a name in the search bar.  
   - Display results as a grid of movie posters.

3. **Movie Details**  
   - Tap on a movie in the grid to view detailed information.

4. **Like and Store Movies**  
   - Mark a movie as liked, and it gets saved in local storage using shared preferences, along with the current date and time.

5. **View and Manage Liked Movies**  
   - View all liked movies in the **Liked Movies Page**.  
   - Option to remove movies from the list, which updates local storage.

## 🛠️ Project Architecture

### MVC (Model-View-Controller) Structure
1. **Models**  
   - Custom modal classes for movie data created manually (e.g., `Movie`, `SearchResult`).  
   - No third-party tools were used.

2. **Views**  
   - Separate screens for each feature (e.g., `SplashScreen`, `HomePage`, `DetailPage`, `LikedMoviesPage`).  
   - Organized into `screens` and `components` folders.

3. **Controllers/Providers**  
   - Separate providers for API calls, local storage management, and movie handling.
